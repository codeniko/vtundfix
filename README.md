Vtundfix
========

Vtundfix  is  a  daemon written in bash to  keep Vtund up and running. If Vtund or any interface associated with Vtund fails, Vtundfix will restart it to  fix the tunnel.

It comes paired with a "Vtundctl" which merges the init scripts and main binary calls of both "Vtund" and "Vtundfix"
